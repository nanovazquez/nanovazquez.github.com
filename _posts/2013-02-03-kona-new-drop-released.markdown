A few days ago we have published a new drop of the first drop of the [Patterns & Practices Kona Guidance](http://konaguidance.codeplex.com/) on Codeplex. 

For those who are not familiar with this project, the goal is to provide written guidance as well as reference implementation to describe recommended practices for building LOB Windows 8 client apps using WinRT and .NET. This guidance will focus on how to create apps that are maintainable and testable, porting some of the best practices of previous versions of [Prism](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/) and [MVVM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405484.aspx). 

> Note: For more information about the project and its scope, please refer to [Blaine's](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/blaine/archive/2012/12/13/prism-on-net-4-5-and-the-road-to-windows-8-apps.aspx) post.

We are early in the project so **we need your review and feedback**. Also, expect regular updates of the bits, that will include new features and code improvements. Stay tuned!
